# LoginMaJig
A tool to help automate server logins; working particularly well with RMM tools that otherwise limit automation options.

I don't recall exactly which version of AutoIt was used to compile, but I suspect it'd work with whatever was the latest 2013-'17 or so.

The `loginmajig.kxf` file iirc is the 'source' for Koda, which was an AutoIt-specific GUI designer.
